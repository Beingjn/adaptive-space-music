A simple mod that alters the default space music behavior.

New behavior:
Planet maps only → nothing changes, no space music
Space maps only → original space music sequence
Space + planet → mixed sequence with all planet and space tracks

Works on both normal and combat music.
Includes all normal and combat music from all DLCs, but will work without them.
Doesn’t override any vanilla music sequences. Anomaly music plays as normal.

Compatibility:
The mod adds a new transition worker that plays mixed sequences when both space and planet maps are present, so it’s partially compatible with music mods. Tracks those mods add won’t play while the mixed sequence is active.
